# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification - ML Project

A beginner-friendly machine learning project using the famous **Iris dataset**, built to classify flowers into three species: *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica* based on petal and sepal features.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

In this project, I built a supervised machine learning classification model using the Iris dataset. The goal was to learn and apply the full ML workflow — from data exploration and visualization to training and evaluation.

## 🔍 Dataset Details

- Source: Scikit-learn’s built-in `load_iris()` dataset
- Features:  
  - Sepal length  
  - Sepal width  
  - Petal length  
  - Petal width
- Target: Flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

## ⚙️ Technologies & Tools

- Python  
- Google Colab  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Seaborn, Matplotlib

## 📈 ML Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
   - Checked for null values
   - Viewed dataset shape and structure

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Displayed feature correlations
   - Visualized heatmaps and class distributions

3. **Model Building**
   - Used `RandomForestClassifier` from scikit-learn
   - Trained model on 70% of the dataset

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Achieved **100% accuracy** on test data
   - Used metrics: **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score**
   - Confusion Matrix heatmap for prediction insights

## 📊 Results

- **Model Accuracy:** 1.0  
- **Evaluation Metrics:**  
  - Precision, Recall, and F1-score were all perfect on the test set  
- **Visuals:**  
  - Heatmap of feature correlation  
  - Confusion matrix for model evaluation
